# Security and Performance

Production-ready security and performance requirements for DirectDrive Authority Engine, designed to handle both business validation and tourism client scaling.

## Security Requirements

### Frontend Security
- **CSP Headers:** `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' vercel.app; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' fonts.googleapis.com`
- **XSS Prevention:** All user inputs sanitized using DOMPurify, React's built-in escaping for dynamic content
- **Secure Storage:** JWT tokens in httpOnly cookies, sensitive data in encrypted localStorage with crypto-js

### Backend Security  
- **Input Validation:** Zod schemas for all API endpoints, type-safe validation in `packages/shared/src/schemas`
- **Rate Limiting:** 100 requests/minute per IP for public endpoints, 1000 requests/minute for authenticated users
- **CORS Policy:** `https://directdrivelogistic.com`, `https://*.vercel.app`, configured per environment

### Authentication Security
- **Token Storage:** Supabase JWT in secure, httpOnly, sameSite cookies with 1-hour expiration
- **Session Management:** Automatic refresh tokens, session invalidation on suspicious activity
- **Password Policy:** N/A - Using Supabase Auth with social login (Google, GitHub) for business users

### n8n Webhook Security
- **Signature Validation:** HMAC-SHA256 validation for all n8n webhook payloads
- **IP Whitelist:** n8n Cloud IP ranges only for webhook endpoints
- **Timeout Limits:** 30-second webhook processing timeout to prevent DoS attacks

### Database Security
- **Row Level Security:** Supabase RLS enabled on all tables, client isolation by industry/user
- **API Key Rotation:** Monthly rotation of Supabase service keys, automated via GitHub Actions
- **Connection Encryption:** TLS 1.3 for all database connections, encrypted at rest

## Performance Optimization

### Frontend Performance
- **Bundle Size Target:** < 500KB initial bundle, < 2MB total with code splitting
- **Loading Strategy:** Route-based code splitting, lazy loading for dashboard components
- **Caching Strategy:** SWR for API data, Supabase client-side caching for real-time subscriptions

### Backend Performance
- **Response Time Target:** < 200ms for API endpoints, < 2s for complex analytics queries
- **Database Optimization:** Indexes on `keywords(industry, language, status)`, `content_pieces(created_at, industry)`
- **Caching Strategy:** Supabase Edge caching for keyword queries, Redis for session storage (future)

### Real-time Performance
- **WebSocket Connections:** Max 1000 concurrent connections, auto-scaling via Vercel
- **Citation Monitoring:** Batch processing every 6 hours, parallel AI model queries
- **Dashboard Updates:** Debounced real-time updates, 100ms batching for multiple changes

### n8n Workflow Performance
- **Execution Time:** < 30 minutes per content generation workflow (current requirement)
- **Concurrent Workflows:** Support 5 parallel workflows, queuing system for overflow
- **Resource Management:** API rate limiting per workflow, cost tracking per execution

### AI Model Performance
- **Response Time Targets:**
  - GPT-4: < 30 seconds for 1000-word content
  - Gemini: < 45 seconds for 1000-word content  
  - Citation monitoring: < 5 seconds per query batch
- **Cost Optimization:** Model routing based on language/cost efficiency, caching for repeated queries
- **Rate Limit Management:** Built-in retry logic, fallback model selection

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Application Monitoring
- **Uptime Monitoring:** 99.9% target, Vercel built-in monitoring + external pingdom
- **Error Tracking:** Sentry integration for frontend/backend errors, alert on >1% error rate
- **Performance Monitoring:** Vercel Analytics for Core Web Vitals, custom metrics for citation accuracy

### Business Metrics Monitoring  
- **DirectDrive KPIs:** Citation improvement tracking, content generation success rate
- **Client Performance:** Response time monitoring per client, SLA compliance tracking
- **Revenue Metrics:** Monthly recurring revenue tracking, churn prediction alerts

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- **Database Performance:** Supabase query performance monitoring, slow query alerts
- **API Performance:** Response time percentiles, rate limiting effectiveness
- **Real-time Connections:** WebSocket connection health, message delivery success rate

## Scalability Planning

### Traffic Scaling
- **Current Capacity:** 10,000 monthly active sessions (DirectDrive validation phase)
- **Tourism Scaling:** 100,000+ monthly sessions (10-50 tourism clients)
- **Auto-scaling:** Vercel Edge Functions auto-scale, Supabase connection pooling

### Data Scaling
- **Database Growth:** 100GB projected for 50 clients, automatic Supabase scaling
- **Content Storage:** Supabase Storage for generated content, CDN for published assets
- **Backup Strategy:** Daily automated backups, 30-day retention, cross-region replication

### Cost Scaling
- **Current Costs:** ~$50/month (development phase with free tiers)
- **Production Scaling:** ~$500/month (50 clients), linear scaling with usage
- **Cost Monitoring:** Monthly budget alerts, per-client cost attribution

## Operational Security & Performance

### CI/CD Pipeline Security
- **GitHub Actions Security:** Secrets management, signed commits, audit logging
- **Deployment Security:** Environment isolation, rollback authentication, change approval
- **Pipeline Integrity:** Automated security scanning, dependency vulnerability checks

### Feature Flag Performance
- **Toggle Response Time:** <30 seconds for all feature flag changes
- **Configuration Caching:** Edge-cached feature flag states for performance
- **Emergency Disable:** <5 second feature disable capability for critical issues

### Rollback Performance Targets
- **Emergency Rollback:** <5 minutes complete system rollback
- **Epic-Level Rollback:** <15 minutes for database changes
- **Feature Rollback:** <2 minutes using feature flags
- **Business Continuity:** Zero DirectDrive operation interruption during rollbacks

### Monitoring Performance Requirements
- **Real-time Alerts:** <30 seconds from incident to notification
- **Health Check Response:** <10 seconds for all critical endpoints
- **Dashboard Updates:** <5 seconds for real-time metrics refresh
- **n8n Workflow Monitoring:** <1 minute detection of workflow failures

**Security and Performance Rationale:**
These specifications ensure DirectDrive Authority Engine meets enterprise-grade security requirements while maintaining the performance needed for real-time citation monitoring and multi-client scaling. The security model supports both single-tenant DirectDrive validation and multi-tenant tourism client operations, with comprehensive operational security protecting business continuity.
