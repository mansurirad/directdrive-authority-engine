# Epic 4: Modular Industry Framework Implementation

**Expanded Goal:** Design and implement industry-agnostic architecture that allows easy content module switching from DirectDrive logistics focus to tourism industry application, validating the framework's reusability for future business expansion.

## Story 4.1: Industry-Agnostic Database Architecture
**As a** system architect,
**I want** database design that supports any industry vertical without structural changes,
**so that** the same technical foundation can serve logistics, tourism, healthcare, or any other industry.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Database schema designed with industry-neutral structure (keywords, content_pieces, clients)
2. Industry tagging system allows content categorization without schema modifications
3. DirectDrive logistics data serves as template for tourism industry data structure
4. Migration scripts created for moving between industry focuses
5. Multi-tenant capabilities support multiple industries simultaneously
6. Data integrity maintained during industry module switching

## Story 4.2: Configurable Content Generation Framework
**As a** content generation system,
**I want** modular prompt templates and keyword management,
**so that** switching from logistics to tourism content requires configuration changes, not code rewrites.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Industry-specific prompt templates stored in database configuration, not hard-coded
2. Keyword management system supports any industry vertical through configuration
3. Content templates use variables for industry-specific terminology and context
4. AI model routing configurable per industry requirements
5. Cultural context modules reusable across industries with appropriate adaptations
6. DirectDrive logistics configuration demonstrates tourism industry adaptability

## Story 4.3: Industry Module Management Interface
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** interface for managing different industry modules and configurations,
**so that** I can efficiently switch between logistics and tourism focuses or manage multiple industries.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Industry module selection interface allows switching between active configurations
2. Configuration management stores industry-specific settings (keywords, prompts, monitoring queries)
3. Module import/export functionality enables sharing industry configurations
4. Industry performance comparison shows effectiveness across different verticals
5. Backup and restore capabilities protect industry-specific configurations
6. User access controls manage permissions for different industry modules

## Story 4.4: Cross-Industry Analytics and Comparison
**As a** business strategist,
**I want** analytics comparing performance across different industry implementations,
**so that** I can identify most effective markets and optimize resource allocation.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Cross-industry performance dashboard compares logistics vs. tourism effectiveness
2. Market opportunity analysis identifies high-potential industry verticals
3. Resource utilization tracking shows cost efficiency across industries
4. Revenue potential modeling projects returns for different industry focuses
5. Competitive analysis framework adaptable to any industry vertical
6. ROI comparison guides strategic decisions about industry expansion priorities

## Story 4.5: Framework Documentation and Replication
**As a** future system implementer,
**I want** comprehensive documentation for replicating industry modules,
**so that** new verticals can be added efficiently without technical expertise requirements.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Industry module creation documentation with step-by-step procedures
2. Template library provides starting points for common business verticals
3. Configuration examples demonstrate DirectDrive logistics to tourism transition
4. Best practices guide covers cultural adaptation, keyword research, content strategy
5. Troubleshooting guide addresses common industry adaptation challenges
6. Video tutorials demonstrate module creation and management processes
