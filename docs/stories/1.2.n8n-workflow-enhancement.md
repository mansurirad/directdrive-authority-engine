## Dev Notes

### Implementation Context
This story enhanced the existing 60+ node n8n SEO Content Generator workflow to work with the new Supabase database infrastructure established in Story 1.1, while maintaining all existing functionality and adding DirectDrive logistics specialization.

### Workflow Architecture Changes
**Database Integration:**
- Replaced Google Sheets Read/Write nodes with Supabase Query/Insert/Update nodes
- Added Supabase authentication configuration using service key
- Implemented connection pooling for database operations
- Added transaction handling for atomic keyword processing

**DirectDrive Logistics Optimization:**
- Added industry filter nodes to process only logistics keywords
- Implemented language routing for English, Arabic, Kurdish, Farsi content
- Added DirectDrive service category processing (freight, customs, warehousing, international shipping)
- Integrated Kurdistan regional context into content generation prompts

**Performance Enhancements:**
- Implemented parallel processing branches for multiple keywords
- Added execution time monitoring and optimization nodes
- Configured workflow resource limits and timeout handling
- Optimized AI API calls with caching and retry logic

### Content Quality System
**Logistics Validation Nodes:**
